  - <b> Scalable validation of automated bicycle and pedestrian counters: evidence from Washington, D.C. </b> Vahid Bakhshi, 
Md Shazalal Tushar, Sarah Bayldon, Sarah Worth O’Brien, Ralph Buehler, Steve Hankey, Krista Nordback: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198225003409 - *Abstract: "Data from automated pedestrian and bicycle counters is important in planning for active transportation. Counter validation approaches vary, from spot checks at initial installation of individual counters to rigorous comparison with manual count data. Since best practices differ, the data validity from counters is often unknown. This study identifies (1) the minimum number of manual count hours needed to reliably validate automated counters and (2) key factors affecting the accuracy of correction functions. Findings suggest that using 12–15 hours of count data to validate automated counters is the point of diminishing returns to develop reliable correction functions across site volumes. Counters that passed our validation criteria were associated with a 46% decrease in mean RMSE. For bicycle counters, greater accuracy was associated with validation on warmer, non-summer days, during peak hours, and with no precipitation. For pedestrian counters, higher accuracy was associated with validation during summer, spring, or early winter with no precipitation.*
  - <b> Decoding the first-and-last mile: Analyzing the transit connecting bike share GPS routes in Hamilton, Ontario with spatiotemporal distance decay </b> 
Zehui Yin, Darren M. Scott: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X25001401?via%3Dihub - *Abstract: "The well-known first-and-last mile (FM/LM) problem has long plagued traditional fixed-route public transit systems. Recently, emerging shared micromobility services, such as bike share, have been gaining popularity and quickly developing worldwide. These services present the potential to complement public transit by serving as an FM/LM solution. This study leverages Hamilton Bike Share Global Positioning System routes data and employs a novel spatiotemporal distance decay with built environment adjustment method to quantify whether bike share trips are FM/LM trips on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1. This approach provides a more detailed usage pattern at the road level and a more realistic identification of FM/LM trips compared to the commonly used buffer zone approach applied to origin and destination pair trip data."*

  - <b> Addressing transport disadvantages in regional and rural areas through integrated mobility services </b> Haoning Xi, John D. Nelson, Corinne Mulley, 
David A. Hensher, Chinh Ho, Camila Balbontin: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0739885925001337 - *Abstract: "This paper explores mobility barriers and the impact of transport disadvantage on vulnerable individuals (such as the elderly, disabled, and low-income) in regional and rural areas. Qualitative analysis is conducted using the data collected from community group discussions in three regional towns in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and identifies a significant gap in the literature concerning the potential for integrated mobility solutions to address mobility barriers of the transport-disadvantaged in regional and rural settings. Our findings highlight the need to strive for the “gold standard” including better infrastructure, integration of services, increased safety, comfort, and convenience, and greater availability, affordability, and flexibility of mobility services. The insights from the discussions suggest that integrated mobility solutions, have significant potential to ameliorate these barriers, improve the quality of life and promote social inclusion for rural populations. The paper provides policy implications on improving the appeal and adoption of integrated mobility solutions more generally in regional and rural settings.*
  - <b> Quantifying minimum mobility and transport needs: The who, the where and the why </b> Marlin Arnz, Zakia Soomauroo, Vivien Fisch-Romito, 
Jihoon Min, Joel Millward-Hopkins, Paul Natsuo Kishimoto, Benigna Boza-Kiss, Caroline Zimm, Bas van Ruijven: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629625003871?via%3Dihub - *Abstract: "The concept of “sustainable consumption corridors” bridges two topics critical to assessing energy and transport systems: human wellbeing and planetary boundaries. However, large disagreements remain regarding how to define minimum, essential and decent levels of demand, which form the floor of such corridors. Aggregate approaches based upon distance travelled (e.g. passenger-kilometres) are insufficient, as they omit why people move. To address this gap, we build upon established theories of fundamental human needs and needs-oriented mobility research to define “decent mobility” as the condition when an individual can enact a set of trips that allow satisfaction of their needs, within their resources and capabilities. We explain how this definition unifies (i) individual capabilities and resources (time, money), (ii) available physical infrastructure and services, and (iii) socio-political contexts that shape personal freedom. We then operationalise and quantify decent mobility with a “persona” approach. We model two case studies with very distinct mobility systems – Switzerland and Mauritius – to illustrate the flexibility of the framework. They show which methods and data sources are required to consistently assess decent mobility of individuals, as well as travel time, distance, energy use, and emissions. Overall, the framework offers a method for evaluating present and future transport systems by putting human needs and their heterogeneity at the centre."*

  - <b> The Two Faces of Progress: Decarbonizing Asia’s Transport Sector </b> ATO:  https://asiantransportobservatory.org/analytical-outputs/ato-cop30-climate-tracker/ - *The unfolding story of Asia's transport sector emissions mirrors two realities— one of progress and persistence. On one side lies a remarkable shift: emissions growth has slowed, efficiency has improved, and electric mobility is gaining ground. Decoupling between transport activity and greenhouse gas emissions, once unimaginable, is now taking shape in Asia as a whole. This is the hopeful face of progress — proof that policy, technology, and ambition can bend the curve. But the other face tells a harder truth. Transport emissions continue to rise across much of the region, with Asia now accounting for more than the combined emissions of Europe and North America. Gains remain uneven, concentrated in a handful of economies, while a billion legacy vehicles and emissions-intensive systems keep the sector locked in old trajectories. Ahead of COP30 in Brazil, the Asian Transport Observatory (ATO) releases The Two Faces of Progress: Decarbonizing Asia’s Transport Sector — a study that captures the region’s dual story: one of leadership and lag, of progress made and ground yet to cover. It is a reminder of how far Asia has come, and how far it must still go to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement.*
  - <b> State of Climate Action 2025 </b> WRI: https://www.wri.org/research/state-climate-action-2025 -*The State of Climate Action 2025 provides the most comprehensive roadmap yet for closing the global gap in climate action to help keep the Paris Agreement goal within reach, as well as grades collective efforts to combat the climate crisis across key sectors. It finds that recent progress toward 1.5°C-aligned targets has largely failed to materialize at the required pace and scale and highlights where action must accelerate this decade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, scale up carbon removal and increase climate finance.*

Xiaoyan Feng, Weize Song, Alejandro Tirachini, Constantinos Antoniou: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856425002538?dgcid=coauthor - *Abstract: "Ride-splitting, a special kind of ride-hailing service, presents significant potential for energy savings and emission reduction. Studying factors that promote ride-splitting can help build sustainable transportation systems. Although many studies have analyzed the impact of the built environment and sociodemographic variables on ride-splitting, there is a lack of consideration of variables specific to ride-hailing systems. This study aims to analyze the complex impact of explanatory variables (including ride-hailing system-specific variables) on ride-splitting, based on an interpretable machine-learning framework.

  - <b> Evaluating the safety and speed impacts of the 20mph speed limit in the UK: Evidence and insights </b> Mohammed Quddus, Athanasios Theofilatos,
Mingjie Feng, Rune Elvik: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457525002969?dgcid=coauthor - *Abstract: "Studies on the effectiveness of 20mph speed limits in the UK vary due to differences in context, methods, data, environments, and schemes. Many of them do not account for confounding factors like regression-to-the-mean, long-term trends, or changes in traffic volume, making it difficult to generalise their overall impact. Moreover, there is a need to account for the different effects of physical measures (speed humps, cameras) and sign-only measures, when examining the benefits of 20mph limits. Hence, the present paper attempts to add to current knowledge in the field and address these issues by developing a methodology to assess and classify the quality and validity of existing studies on 20mph speed limits in the UK."*

  - <b> Job Accessibility, Commute Time, and Efficiency of Urban Transport: Evidence from Dar es Salaam </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/dfb6b458-c927-4dcf-b1e8-7fe96e844fb7 - *Many African countries are experiencing rapid urbanization. However, job creation has not kept pace, resulting in persistently high urban unemployment rates. Based on basic job search theory, the paper revisits the relationship between employment and transport connectivity at various levels, using data from Dar es Salaam, one of Africa’s fastest-growing developing cities. It shows that those who commute longer distances tend to earn higher wages. Therefore, enhancing the efficiency of urban transport systems is crucial. The paper also identifies variations in the relationship between wages and commute times across different transport modes. Commuters using motorized transportation, particularly private cars and taxis, generally earn more than those using nonmotorized transport. Hence, there is a potential risk associated with the overreliance on private transport modes. The gender wage gap persists in Dar es Salaam, but the positive effect of commuting on wages is greater for women, which can contribute to reducing the gap.*

The analysis focuses on the immediate effects of higher fuel taxes (and lower subsidies) on household purchasing power in a partial equilibrium exercise.*
  - <b> Rural Road Infrastructure and Women’ s Empowerment in India </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/6f387808-7940-4ce1-bf5b-d0f9211caec8 - *The paper examines the impact of a rural road construction program in India on a range of outcomes that capture women’s empowerment comprehensively. While spatial integration can ease mobility constraints and provide women with increased education and employment opportunities, the extent of benefits might be limited by underlying gender norms. The paper identifies the impact of the policy by exploiting the program rule that assigned roads based on the village population in a two-way fixed effect framework. The results suggest that the policy reduces mobility restrictions faced by women and improves norms around domestic violence and intra- household agency. It also finds a positive impact of the policy on female education; however, there is limited impact on female employment.*

  - <b> Evaluating the impact of Public-Private Partnerships Enabling Conditions on Infrastructure Development: Evidence from Latin America and the Caribbean </b> IDB // Casady, Carter B ; Suárez-Alemán, Ancor - *This paper investigates the impact of public-private partnership (PPP)-enabling conditions on infrastructure development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Using a unique longitudinal dataset, this study analyzes how institutional conditions in 26 LAC countries influenced PPP investment activity between 2009 and 2022. The findings indicate political and social will, along with institutional capacity, are significant predictors of PPP investment, while market reliability, transparency, governance mechanisms, and regulatory regimes, although important, are less impactful. These findings highlight the critical importance of political stability and strong institutional frameworks in driving PPP investment activity in the region.* 
  - <b> The impact of container shipping costs on import and consumer prices </b> OECD: https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/the-impact-of-container-shipping-costs-on-import-and-consumer-prices_957f0c0c-en.html  - *Container shipping prices have experienced remarkable volatility, having risen substantially following Red Sea shipping disruptions, fallen with rising global supply and fluctuated in response to trade policy changes. We build on the existing literature by estimating the pass-through of container goods shipping costs into imported manufactured goods, excluding imported commodities, where the relationship with shipping cost pass-through is complicated by energy prices. We find that the impact of container shipping inflation on import price inflation and core inflation is smaller when commodity imports are excluded. Despite the smaller estimates of pass-through, container shipping cost shocks remain relevant for policy makers to consider, given continued very large price shocks. The results are robust to controls for supply shortages and shipping market conditions.*

Most of the victims were traveling by motorcycle. This assessment of the burden of RTIs, disabilities, and deaths consists of: (1) a road safety analysis using available official data in Brazil; (2) a computation of globally recognized metrics for assessing the burden of disease, including years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); (3) a comprehensive cost analysis of traffic crashes in Brazil to estimate expenses related to medical care, hospital stays, production losses, human and administrative costs, property damage, and other traffic-related costs; and (4) the collection and analysis of primary data on RTIs from hospital surveillance and the monitoring of crash victims after hospital discharge—as assessed one and three months after discharge.*
  - <b> Infrastructure and Regulatory Needs for Green Freight Corridors </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099082525162019527 - *Decarbonizing Brazil’s road freight transport sector is essential to achieving the country’s 2050 emission targets. To scale this effort, Brazil must transition from diesel-powered trucks to low- and zero-carbon alternatives powered by electricity or hydrogen, each requiring substantial investment in recharging or refueling infrastructure. This note outlines a near-term strategy for promoting green freight corridors through a multi-criteria assessment of promising routes, demand forecasting based on zero-emission truck adoption, and analysis of the techno-economic feasibility of infrastructure deployment. Given current technology trends, early implementation is expected to focus on battery electric trucks, necessitating a roadmap for corridor-based charging infrastructure investment, supported by incentives for zero-emission truck adoption and a robust renewable energy sector. As vehicle and infrastructure technologies evolve—especially under Brazil’s ambitious low-emission hydrogen plans—strategies for decarbonizing road freight must be regularly revisited and refined.*

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of various strategies to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport while maintaining its role in overall development. (i) shifting traffic from higher to lower carbon-intensity modes; (ii) reducing empty loads; (iii) improving the energy efficiency of vehicles; and (iv) adopting alternative fuels. Results show that no single strategy implemented in isolation, will be able to significantly mitigate emissions from freight transport in Brazil. Therefore, an integrated, multi-strategy approach is needed for achieving sustainable emission reductions over time.*

The emergence of ridesourcing presents a dual possibility regarding car ownership: it can reduce the need for private car ownership by providing a viable alternative, or it can encourage car ownership by providing an opportunity to earn extra income through ridesourcing. Using the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study dataset from 2009 to 2019, this study examines how ridesourcing affects the changes in household car ownership. After controlling for various factors, our results suggest that households are less likely to acquire a car in the presence of ridesourcing while car disposal decisions are mainly driven by household composition and residential relocation factors. We also examine the heterogeneous effects that vary by different numbers of household cars and residential areas. Our results can inform transport authorities and policymakers when planning a sustainable transport system with reduced car dependency."*

More than two thirds of daily commuters are transported by minibus taxis in cities. However, the electrification process is prohibited by multiple factors, such as an already fragile grid network, and an energy scarcity in the region. Planning for eventual electrification is further complicated by the sector’s unique, decentralised, unscheduled, and demand-driven nature. We use the concepts of vehicle-day and fleet-day to quantify the relationship between mobility and electricity demand, which are linked by the charging infrastructure and charging strategies.

Its point of departure is the sufficiency principle informed by conditions of scarcity for private car use in cities. It focuses on questions of fairness in assigning hypothetical car use budgets for the case of London. Two different budgets are considered, one associated with carbon emission ceilings and another for space constraints. The study that underpins this paper is based on a mixed method approach including a dedicated representative survey for London, a deliberation simulation based on a citizens’ jury with nine participants and a pilot behavioural experiment alongside interviews with a total of 19 London car drivers. Three key findings are established: First, deliberative engagement can be a constructive and feasible approach adding to the general democratic legitimacy of decision making in transport policy. Second, while fairness deliberations, perceptions and sentiments are complex, coherent understandings do emerge for both differential treatments of social groups and priorities of fairness principles. Third, car use budgets may be a helpful tool that can be indirectly utilised for policy design and deliberative formats."*

BNRs entail major equity impacts but existing approaches to assessing those impacts often fall short in various ways. This study reviews 45 BNRs across 40 agencies and produces a normative four-level analytical framework for analyzing their equity impacts. We argue that BNR equity analyses should clearly define target populations, impacts assessed, and the rules used to make equity determinations. Current equity analyses often rely on census data and proximity-based metrics, which overlook the lived experiences and barriers faced by older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers. We recommend incorporating rider-based sources, such as on-board surveys, and integrating community feedback to capture who benefits from or is burdened by service changes. We advocate for combining systemwide and route-level evaluations to reveal more granular equity impacts and support responsive design changes."*

Forecasting who is adopting and when is crucial to planning infrastructure, creating incentives, and ensuring equity. We identify different clusters of adopters in California, examine adoption rates within them, and forecast adoption trajectories. Clusters are classified by revealed characteristics using results from a multi-year survey of 18,921 plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) adopters. Eight clusters are identified: four each among single-vehicle and multi-vehicle households. We classify the population into these segments and simulate future PEV adoption using Bass diffusion. We compare adoption trajectories—assuming current rates of adoption, a scenario of 100% new vehicle sales by 2035, and a scenario of “net zero” by 2045. Our analysis finds large clusters with low to-date PEV adoption, encompassing 47% of the population, and results reveal some clusters are not on track to meet California sales targets and/or climate goals.*

While the sector’s resilience has been remarkable in adapting to the challenges experienced since February 2022, the existing infrastructure is being stressed by these new trade dynamics for which the system was not initially designed to serve in full. Congestion at land border crossing points, downscaled operations at the ports, and a lack of specialized equipment, to name three factors, have driven up transport costs and reduced operational efficiency. Besides such current challenges, in the medium term, Ukraine’s reconstruction and economic recovery will require transport services and infrastructure that support its growth and competitiveness in the region and internationally. Responding to this context, the objective of this Report is twofold: to present the major developments in Ukraine’s transport sector for international trade since February 2022, elucidating how alterations in trade structure and the changing availability of road, rail and port infrastructure have affected freight volumes, how freight is moved, and the costs of moving it; and more forward-looking, to identify high-level strategic actions that can not only make the transport sector more efficient in responding to current trading challenges but also enhance its operational capacity in the medium term, based on expected developments in freight transport.*

However, obtaining high-quality trajectory data remains challenging, especially in urban environments where traditional methods like stationary cameras fall short. Existing drone-based datasets often lack full coverage of traffic states and critical merging and diverging behaviors at ramps. This study presents MiTra (Milan Trajectories), a high-resolution traffic trajectory dataset collected using six drones over a 900 m section of the A50 urban freeway in Milan, Italy. Spanning all traffic states from free flow to congestion, it captures detailed vehicle behavior at on-ramps and off-ramps through nine flight campaigns for 135 min. It includes 124 641 vehicle trajectories, averaging 650 m in length after stitching, with detailed positions, speeds, and accelerations. Nearly half of the vehicles executed lane changes. The dataset provides stitched trajectory data, raw drone videos, and tracking logs. Comprehensive quality checks, including vehicle detection and video stitching validation, ensure its reliability for traffic modeling, autonomous driving research, and computer vision applications."*

Since 2020, rates of moderate and severe food insecurity have risen across the region, while key indicators in early childhood nutrition persist at high levels across both lower- and upper-middle-income states. Rising food prices play a key role in limiting access to healthy and affordable diets for the populations of these countries. In 2022 and 2023, food price inflation reached or exceeded 10 percent in Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Across almost all of these countries, white maize prices remain more than 40 percent higher than their levels in 2021, while prices for red and black beans rose by 40 percent to 90 percent over the same period. These price increases have disproportionately affected poorer and rural households.

Cities are integrated labor markets, but due to unplanned peri-urban growth, the geographic boundaries of local labor markets do not necessarily coincide with those of existing administrative units and municipal boundaries. As such cities need to rethink their “urban growth boundaries.” Second, cities face substantial differences in governance structures, municipal capacities, access to markets, connectivity, skills, and labor pool. Thus, the scope for growth varies across urban areas. Third, most cities face many cross-cutting constraints such as access to serviced land and infrastructure finance and will need to prioritize interventions. Fourth, while industrial estates, corridors and zones are critical in terms of providing employment opportunities, systematic planning for urbanizing areas around industrial zones lags industrial planning. Strengthening India’s system of cities will be critical to meeting its ambitious industrial and economic development goals.*

Existing literature on trade and emissions primarily focuses on countries' net export emissions, often neglecting the emissions saved by importing products instead of producing them domestically. The environmental impact from trade is influenced by the balance between emissions generated from exporting goods and emissions avoided by not producing them domestically. This paper investigates the environmental impacts of trade, focusing on the spatial differences in production emissions. Our estimates indicate that direct emissions embodied in exports are significant and rising, accounting for 31 percent of annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 25 percent of annual particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in 2021. However, considering the direct emissions saved through imports, trade results in a reduction of global GHG emissions annually by up to 2.2 percent from 2004 to 2021, as it allows countries with high emission intensity to import rather than produce domestically. This reduction is not observed in PM2.5 emissions, where trade leads to an increase of up to 1 percent. These findings highlight the discrepancy in emission intensities between exporting and importing countries, which influences the impact of trade on global emissions."*

However, to achieve meaningful and lasting impact, it is imperative to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing capacity development programmes, identify gaps, and tailor interventions to meet the evolving needs of transport professionals, city authorities, and other stakeholders. With the UN Decade of Sustainable Transport 2026-2035 right ahead of us, further action is needed to continue paving a clear and measurable transformation path – backed by robust data – towards a post-fossil and sustainable transport sector. There remains significant uncertainty and only limited evidence on the impact of the capacity gap in the transport sector on the likelihood of achieving

More than two thirds of daily commuters are transported by minibus taxis in cities. However, the electrification process is prohibited by multiple factors, such as an already fragile grid network, and an energy scarcity in the region. Planning for eventual electrification is further complicated by the sector’s unique, decentralised, unscheduled, and demand-driven nature. We use the concepts of vehicle-day and fleet-day to quantify the relationship between mobility and electricity demand, which are linked by the charging infrastructure and charging strategies. To investigate the effects of the charging requirements, data from 17 minibus taxis in Stellenbosch, South Africa was used with a bespoke software built to simulate the driving and charging of the taxis. Different charging rates (7.2 kW, 22 kW and 50 kW) were tested as well as having different charging locations, that of the depot and home and a combination of the two.

The paper presents a web-based tool designed to assist commuters in selecting eco-friendly routes. This tool combines a React.js frontend for intuitive user input with a Go back end that processes real-time data to rank and deliver route suggestions based on air pollution and energy consumption, in addition to distance and time. This study is the first to showcase the LECR in India, demonstrating that selecting this route can save up to 28% of energy in South Delhi. Daily variability analysis conducted at different hours revealed that peak-hour times correlate with increased exposure and energy consumption. Although these results are initial and could be further enhanced with better data, the preliminary results are encouraging.

Utilizing a stated preference approach with a hybrid choice model, this research explores how these factors, along with attitudinal constructs, impact user decisions. The findings reveal that remaining driving range plays a critical role, with significant individual variability in its sensitivity, while perceived range anxiety did not significantly influence choices. Recent changes in helmet regulations have shifted preferences towards faster vehicles. Furthermore, dynamic pricing strategies, such as adjusting ride or unlock fees, can incentivize the use of less desirable vehicles with lower battery range or aid in user-based relocation. Nevertheless, low-range vehicles are less likely to be chosen, even with incentives. These insights provide valuable guidance for operators of electric moped sharing system to improve fleet management and optimize user satisfaction through strategic pricing and battery management."*

However, congestion is typically assessed from a mobility perspective using traffic performance measures, with limited attention to its impact on urban accessibility. Here, we propose reframing congestion, not merely as problem of slower speeds and longer travel times, but as lost access to opportunities due to excess time in traffic. To illustrate this, we estimate the impact of congestion on employment accessibility in Brazil’s 20 largest cities, analyzing how these effects vary spatially and by income level. Using historical GPS-based traffic speed data, we compare the number of jobs reachable by car within a 15-45-minute window during morning peak versus free-flow conditions. In the most congested cities, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the number of accessible jobs drops by an average of 36%–46.4% due to traffic congestion."*

Contrary to popular perceptions, more driving tends to make communities less prosperous. Conventional planning often assumes that faster, cheaper and more vehicle travel supports economic development but evidence described in this study indicates that, on the contrary,
in mature economies productivity tends to decline with more driving and increases with non-auto travel. This study investigates why this occurs. It identifies several ways that increased vehicle travel can reduce productivity including higher user, infrastructure and external costs; more automobile dependency and sprawl that reduce overall accessibility and non-auto mobility options; increased vehicle and fuel spending that generates few local jobs; and less attractive urban environments.

This has not only hindered Kazakhstan’s ability to leverage its geographical advantage but also led to pronounced regional disparities. Lack of efficient transport links contributed to unequal access to employment, education, healthcare, and social and cultural opportunities. Transit costs were high in terms of time, finances, and vehicle wear and tears, which posed significant obstacles to international commerce and stymied local socioeconomic progress, particularly in the southern regions. These challenges disproportionately impacted women, who faced greater unemployment and suffered from high maternal mortality rates because they cannot quickly reach medical care. These issues were compounded by persistent underinvestment and limited institutional capacity within the road sector, which further impeded the development of robust transportation infrastructure.*
  - <b> Data-informed Mobility Governance </b> ITF: https://www.itf-oecd.org/data-informed-mobility-governance -*To ensure that transport policy decisions ultimately serve the public good, policy makers must gain the best possible understanding of their impacts. This, in turn, requires evidence based on accurate data – among other things. Such transport data can help public authorities capture and understand these policy-relevant phenomena, how they interact with their public policy objectives, and help regulate mobility services for better outcomes. This report explores best practices regarding the collection and use of data and evidence to inform policy decisions. In a time when trust in public authorities is eroding, this report looks at how public authorities can foster public trust in their actions by implementing trust mechanisms at the various stages of the data lifecycle.*

However, many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), lack country-specific VSL estimates. To address this, value transfer is often used, where VSL estimates from other countries are adapted to local situations to estimate the VSL in the countries with no VSL estimates. This paper presents new guidance for VSL value transfer in the context of road safety.*

This contributes significantly to environmental degradation and public health issues, particularly regarding air quality in some major cities in the country, including Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. The current air quality situation in Hanoi and its neighboring provinces of Bac Ninh and Hung Yen necessitates urgent action to reduce pollution levels, and, consequently, population exposure to harmful PM2.5 concentrations. Newly announced air quality-related policies, which will be in effect between 2021 and 2030, are an important step towards decreasing air pollution but do not appear to be sufficient to protect health in the medium-term, that is, until 2030. To explore management options available to policy makers in the near term, this study has developed new data and alternative scenarios analyzing the impact of various air quality measures and policies. Opportunities to achieve national standards across Hanoi and its surrounding areas were identified and provide input into policy discussions on an Air Quality Management (AQM) Plan for Hanoi and its surrounding provinces, as well as for Vietnam in general.*

They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar
research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively.*

From 2019 to 2024, the deployment rate of this non-home charging infrastructure for light-duty electric vehicles (EVs) grew about 25% annually. This is roughly equivalent to estimates of the growth rate needed in annual charging deployment to support continued expansion of the EV market. Charging deployment has not been uniform across the United States, and more chargers have been deployed in states with the most EV sales. Publicly announced investments in charging infrastructure from retailers, automakers, and charging providers sum up to 164,000 new DC fast chargers and 1.5 million new Level 2 chargers in the years ahead.

  - <b> OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators - Monitoring Policies up to 2025 </b> OECD: https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-trade-facilitation-indicators_fd6f27dc-en.html?adestraproject - *This publication provides an overview of the efforts made to expedite the movement, release, and clearance of goods at the border in 163 economies. Progress on trade facilitation – as measured by the OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators (TFIs) – is occurring in all regions as countries seek to ensure that global supply chains remain efficient, adaptable, and responsive to evolving patterns of trade. Border agency co-operation is the top area of progress, yet remains the hardest to further improve. Further efforts are also needed to close the gaps between establishing regulatory frameworks for trade facilitation and their implementation in practice, particularly when automating documents and processes. Going further, increasing efficiencies through simplified and streamlined border processes remains a critical issue for promoting competitiveness and economic growth through trade costs reductions.*

Evidence from Fuzhou, China </b> Yuan Liang, Donggen Wang: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136655452500081X - *Abstract: "Fare-free public transport (FFPT) programs are gaining increasing popularity worldwide as a policy tool to mitigate the negative externalities associated with automobile usage. However, evidence regarding their effectiveness in reducing air pollution, a major automobile externality, remains limited. In this study, we empirically examine the effect of FFPT programs on air quality in Fuzhou, a provincial capital city in China, based on a quasi-experimental design. Using difference-in-differences models, we find that Fuzhou’s FFPT program reduces fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations by 0.332 µg/m3 (2.1 %) in the short run. Furthermore, the program leads to an increase of 129,486 rides (49.8%) in daily subway ridership. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that the health benefits brought by the FFPT program through air quality improvements, including reduced mortality and healthcare expenditures, amount to about 3.09 billion Chinese yuan (or 478.92 million US dollars) annually, which is six times the loss of fare revenue. These findings highlight the potential of fare-free public transport as a sustainable urban transport policy in urban China and contribute to a better understanding of its cost-effectiveness.*

Juan Esteban Sanchez, Victor A. Cantillo-Garcia: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X25000721?dgcid=author - *Abstract: "[...] The results indicate a significant increase in accessibility, satisfaction with public transport, and participation in leisure activities among the treatment group following the implementation of the cable car. However, women experienced a smaller increase in accessibility and expressed lower satisfaction with public transport, potentially due to their caregiving roles and concerns about safety and harassment. These findings underscore the important social and potential economic impacts that transport interventions can have on populations. Public investments of this nature are typically challenging to evaluate through social control trials, but the knowledge generated from this type of experimental evaluation could be highly valuable for policymakers.*
  - <b> Why do cars get a free ride? The social-ecological roots of motonormativity </b> Ian Walker, Marco te Brömmelstroet: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378025000172 -*Abstract:"Motonormativity is a shared bias whereby people judge motorised mobility differently to other comparable topics. This works against societies addressing climate and public health crises effectively. A social-ecological explanation has been suggested for the phenomenon, in which motonormativity is shaped by people’s environments, but this has not been tested. Here we used a large international sample (N = 2035) and novel within-participants testing to show, for the first time, at least two environmental pathways linked to judgement biases: one related to people’s social surroundings and linked with their explicit views on transport, and a separate, more implicit pathway related to higher-level structural influences such as nationality, and living in rural areas. Additionally, respondents dramatically underestimated public support for non-motorised transport relative to their own, a pluralistic ignorance effect likely reflecting another facet of motonormativity. The social-ecological explanation, with its nested environmental influences, helps explain the ‘stickiness’ of automobility, and implies change will be most likely when multiple facets of a person’s social, physical and cultural surroundings align in supporting non-motorised mobility.*

Despite frequent protest following low-car interventions and the importance of acceptance for a successful transition, there is limited understanding of the social acceptance of street space reallocation measures. This research identifies types of attitudes towards temporary street space reallocation measures on the neighborhood level to develop a better understanding of residents’ social acceptance and the underlying explanatory factors. Using a coding frame, interview notes with residents of two neighborhoods in Munich were qualitatively analyzed and grouped into types based on similar characteristics and combinations of characteristics.

Drone-based logistics are expected to improve operations by enhancing flexibility and reducing congestion effects induced by last-mile deliveries. With rising digitalization and urbanization, however, logistics service providers are constantly grappling with the challenge of uncertain real-time demand. This study investigates the problem of planning drone delivery service through an urban air traffic network to fulfill dynamic and stochastic demand. Customer requests – if accepted – generate profit and are serviced by individual drone flights as per request origins, destinations and time windows.*

A comparative case study of the German cities Berlin and Hamburg </b> Christoph Aberle, Stephan Daubitz , Oliver Schwedes, Carsten Gertz: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692325000316 - *Abstract: "This mixed-methods study examines transport poverty in Berlin and Hamburg, combining GIS-based spatial analysis of public transport (PT) service levels with qualitative interviews of 40 welfare recipients about their transport experiences. The research reveals that low-income residents do not have worse absolute access to PT, but per-capita service is poorer due to high population density. This highlights inequities where crowded transport systems diminish service quality. The interviews also show that high PT fares, before the introduction of the €58 “Deutschlandticket,” had been a major barrier, forcing individuals to choose between transport and other essential needs like food and housing. This financial constraint limits mobility, employment, and social interaction. The study’s integration of GIS analysis and personal interviews provides a comprehensive view of transport poverty, capturing both systemic issues and individual coping strategies. The findings suggest a typology of seven mobility types among low-income residents, offering policymakers a framework for targeted interventions. Recommendations include fare reductions, improved per-capita services in dense areas, and enhanced support for vulnerable groups to address both systemic inequalities and financial barriers, advancing a transport equity agenda that promotes social inclusion."*

Unpacking this influence is important for understanding why oppositional responses to climate policy arise among mass publics. We analyze interpretive mechanisms by which social polarization leads to policy opposition in response to a proposed speed limit on highways in Germany. We employ an abductive process-tracing approach to posit and empirically scrutinize possible interpretive mechanisms of opposition, drawing on secondary data from multiple arenas of public discourse: news media (newspapers), online debate (internet forum posts), and political representation (plenary minutes, party programs, resolutions, public statements by representatives)."*

This study proposes a comprehensive methodology for incorporating justice principles in evaluating transportation projects and applies it to a railway case study in Chile. The proposal seeks to measure the impact of implementing specific projects on regional transport justice. This work represents a unique contribution to the literature. To our knowledge, it is the first documented experience attempting to incorporate justice principles developed by Martens (2017) into railway transport projects. It emphasizes standardizing critical processes, such as data acquisition, group and opportunity characterization, and determining appropriate sufficiency thresholds.*

  - <b> Is air/high-speed rail integration the panacea to curb the impact of aviation on climate change? The case of Frankfurt Airport </b> Frédéric Dobruszkes: https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/ejtir/article/view/7477 - *Abstract: "This paper revisits the concept of air/high-speed rail (HSR) integration in the specific case of congested airports, in which airport slots for (super) short-haul flights are freed by replacing them with high-speed trains. Freed slots are then likely allocated to longer flights, which leads to an increase in GHG emissions induced by flights from/to the airport into question. Such an unexpected effect is investigated through the case of Frankfurt Airport, where the HSR infrastructure was designed to connect smoothly with the airport. The ex post investigation isolates the time window during which airport capacity is stable. It confirms the increase in aviation climate impact. This illustrates that air/HSR integration is not always a relevant solution to curb the impact of aviation on climate change."*

Yibing Wang, Simon Hu: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X25000841 - *Abstract: "Given a partially observed road network, how can we predict the traffic state of interested unobserved locations? Traffic prediction is crucial for advanced traffic management systems, with deep learning approaches showing exceptional performance. However, most existing approaches assume sensors are deployed at all locations of interest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, these methods are typically fragile to structural changes in sensing networks, which require costly retraining even for minor changes in sensor configuration. To address these challenges, we propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph model with two key components: (i) a Mixture of Graph Experts (MoGE) with sparse gating mechanisms that dynamically route nodes to specialized graph aggregators, capturing heterogeneous spatial dependencies efficiently; (ii) a graph encoder-decoder architecture that leverages these embeddings to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies for comprehensive traffic state prediction.

Analyses of large samples of individual investment projects based on data in the so-called Flyvbjerg database have documented systematic construction cost overruns and first-year traffic demand shortfalls. They have interpreted these findings as being indicative of negative social welfare consequences of typical transport infrastructure investment projects, but that interpretation has been challenged on methodological grounds. The evidence base of ex post social cost–benefit analyses is growing and it, too, has challenged the suggestion that transport infrastructure projects destroy social welfare. Overall, it seems fair to conclude that our understanding of the project-level social welfare consequences of transport infrastructure is improving but remains far from conclusive. In contrast, aggregate-level quantitative meta-analyses provide robust results of a significant and positive relationship between transport infrastructure and economic activity at the level of regions or countries, especially in the long run and at higher levels of geographical aggregation. These aggregate-level results imply that project-level analyses should indeed consider the entire life cycle of projects, not just construction and the first year of operation, and that they should also acknowledge the presence of network effects as well as wider economic impacts – as difficult to measure and controversial as they are."*

Despite this global mandate, many African countries remain in early stages of compliance, hindered by institutional, legal, and operational challenges. Drawing on interviews with maritime stakeholders and lessons from early adopters such as Ghana and Egypt, the paper outlines a pragmatic roadmap for MSW implementation. It provides a taxonomy of port digital systems, a stepwise strategy toward port call optimization, and a detailed implementation checklist tailored to the African context. Through coordinated policy action, stakeholder engagement, and targeted capacity building, African countries can leverage MSWs to enhance trade facilitation, improve port performance, and drive regional integration. This paper contributes practical guidance to policymakers, port authorities, and development partners supporting Africa’s digital transformation in the maritime sector.*

   -<b> The impact of electric cars on travel behaviour segments: Insights from Norway </b> Ioannis Kosmidis: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920925001130 - *Abstract: *Clustering travellers based on their characteristics and attitudes allows to design more tailored and effective transport policies. Past studies often associated higher environmental awareness with lower car use, assuming that groups showing a mismatch experience a dissonance. However, the development of electric cars (EVs) could have introduced a disruption in this assumption. This hypothesis is tested a Latent Class Analysis of travel behaviour and attitude data of commuters from Nord-Jæren in Norway for 2019 (n = 741) was performed. Three distinct latent classes of commuters have been identified, two consisting of dedicated car users and one of multimodal travellers. The main difference between the first two groups is whether they use an EV. This study suggests that in contexts with high EV deployment, higher environmental awareness should not necessarily be associated with lower car use or higher use of alternative options, and neither should this phenomenon be considered a dissonance.*

We assigned papers to five definition groups based on similarity: (1) Objective and subjective characteristics, (2) subjective-only characteristics, (3) social groups and communities, (4) normative-sustainable notions of future transportation, and (5) papers lacking definitions. Among empirical papers, we identified three broader approaches: Comparative (e.g. city typologies or pre-and-post relocation studies), single-culture (e.g. place-specific mode choice, local discourses) and intervention studies.*

In addition, we propose an agent-based model that allows simulating the effect of market conditions and platform strategies on system performance, accounting for such network effects. This day-to-day model captures sequential decentralized processes characterizing both sides of the two-sided ridesourcing market, i.e. information diffusion, platform registration, platform participation, and learning based on experience. We apply the model on a case representing Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Our simulation results suggest that a profit-maximizing ridesourcing platform may trade-off market transaction volume for higher earnings on successful transactions, a strategy that is harmful to the interests of travellers and drivers, and possibly of (very) limited benefit to the platform."*

Guibo Sun: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837725000341 - *"This paper provides compelling evidence that the ambiguity in state-owned land property rights increases transaction costs in China’s transit-oriented development (TOD) projects. The constitution defines the state as the de jure (legally defined) owner of urban land, but tiers of local government share the de facto (practically controlled) land property rights; this ambiguity complicates land use right transfer for TOD. Through expert interviews, document analysis, and case studies in Guangzhou, we identified three critical issues. First, ambiguity in de facto land property rights has led district governments to relocate the metro depot site from a profitable plot suitable for metro scheduling and property development to land plots that are less advantageous and far away from the station. Second, the coexistence of land allocation and leasing approaches under state ownership discouraged an optimised land assembly for the TOD project. Rigid acquisition sizes designated in land allocation for infrastructure discouraged coordination and prolonged negotiations between the district government and the metro company. Finally, the district government faced a disproportionate fiscal responsibility compared to their land leasing share from the municipal government."*

Peter Berrill, Felix Creutzig: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920925000033 - *Abstract: "Understanding how the built environment influences travel is key to low-carbon urban planning. However, previous cross-sectional studies lack a realistic operationalization of residential self-selection that accounts for its non-linear nature, limiting its applicability to urban planning. We propose a double machine learning (DML) approach that accounts for nonlinearities in residential self-selection and captures non-linear moderating effects. Using travel diaries of 32,201 Berlin residents, we estimate the built environment’s impact on per capita travel-related CO2 emissions. Our results indicate that neglecting nonlinearities overestimates this impact by 13%–18%, inflating the built environment proportion by 13%pt. Age, income, and car ownership also nonlinearly moderate the built environment’s effect, with the effect being largest for middle-aged, high-income, car-owning households, a novel finding. Applying the method to urban planning reveals a 43%pt emissions reduction potential for 64,000 planned Berlin housing units, highlighting the need for evidence-based urban planning to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions in cities."*

City logistics aims to manage urban goods movement while balancing environmental and societal impacts with economic development. The complexity of this field necessitates effective management, and scholars recognize the business model as a valuable tool for capturing system components and predicting changes. While the value proposition, revenue streams, and customer relationships are acknowledged as core components, there is limited understanding of cost structures and revenue streams. To address this gap, qualitative and empirical data from 14 European city logistics projects were analysed. The findings highlight the importance of integrating cost structures and revenue streams into the business model for sustainable and financially viable city logistics initiatives.

Despite progress, full educational access remains challenging, particularly in highly criminal areas.
This paper examines the impact of crime on school access in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Using ancillary data and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), we downscaled official police crime records to street level. By considering different levels of crime tolerance in school path choices, we simulated how crime can force students to walk longer distances to avoid violence.
Our findings indicate a 48.60 % average increase in travel time to the closest school for students whose shortest routes intersect with high-crime areas. This adjustment reduces mean crime exposure by 44.10 % and maximum exposure by 81.94 %. Both individual crime risk aversion and no-go areas of criminal disputes significantly (p 0.05) impacted educational access. Estimating street-level crime exposure was challenging due to spatial bias in official and crowdsourced crime reporting. These methods and insights are crucial for improving educational access in high-crime areas, providing a better understanding of barriers to equitable education, and being applicable to other cities and accessibility studies for various societal needs."*

The TDI employs 30 indicators, classified into eight dimensions covering sustainable, low-carbon transport. The dimensions were identified using a four-phase approach. Through pilot testing in 12 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the TDI benchmarks transport performance, enabling policymakers to prioritise actions to reduce emissions and enhance transport sustainability. While the pilot countries scored relatively well based on the defined ranges and thresholds on indicators such as per capita transport greenhouse gas emissions and finance, they performed less well on public transport availability and electrification. The pilot phase revealed significant gaps for African countries in freight transport activity data and highlighted the need for improved data collection. Additionally, several metrics, including equity and informal transport, were not readily available. The TDI can be a valuable tool for benchmarking performance and informing policy decisions by offering a nuanced understanding of key transport dimensions and policy options. Although the TDI provides insights for policymaking, it is not a standalone solution and requires further analysis and stakeholder engagement for effective implementation."*

The analysis uses a large set of variables describing household behavior to provide a complete picture of the adjustments. The identification combines a household fixed effects strategy with propensity score matching. Some damaging effects of the program are found on the rural population in the two years following the intervention: the price of rice decreases; households reallocate labor away from agriculture and provide more wage work, but the increase in wage income does not compensate for the loss in agricultural income. Nor do households seem to be benefiting from the fall in the price of rice at the consumption level.

We review some of these experiences with the aim of extracting lessons that can provide guidance to policymakers in the design and implementation of successful urban transport reforms. Special emphasis is placed on users' welfare and how different policies impinge on their interests and behavior. Many reforms have faced difficulties by not considering the consequences of policy initiatives on users' welfare, especially their impact on time costs. Another relevant theme discussed in this document is that modern high-quality transit systems are expensive and fare revenues will generally not be sufficient to fund an ambitious reform. If public funds are not available, it is advisable to reduce the scope and scale of reform. Fortunately, there are many low-cost options to improve urban mobility. Furthermore, some pricing policies can improve mobility while raising revenues at the same time; resources that can then be used to subsidize transit services. While the optimal policy package will depend on the specific circumstances of each city and the available funding, what cannot be overlooked is the interest of users and passengers. Policymakers must always place themselves in their shoes and think through how their intended intervention will affect their travel experience, time and financial cost.*
  - <b> The Right to the Night City: Exploring the Temporal Variability of the 15-min City in Milan and Its Implications for Nocturnal Communities </b> Lamia Abdelfattah, Abubakr Albashir, Giulia Ceccarelli, Andrea Gorrini,Federico Messa, Dante Presicce: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/1/22 - *"The needs of night communities and the barriers they face in accessing diverse urban amenities are underexplored in urban planning research. Focus is primarily given to the needs of cultural consumers, frequently overlooking the challenges faced by regular nighttime communities, including night workers. Through a GIS-based analysis, the aim of this research is to shed light on differences in accessibility to core urban services between day and night in the city of Milan. The spatiotemporal analysis was performed using a customized version of the 15-min City Score Toolkit, an open-source, Python-based proprietary tool developed to automate the 15 min access metric estimation. Proprietary Point-Of-Interest (POI) data that were retrieved, sorted and filtered from the Google Places API are used to simulate time-variant walkability maps based on opening hour information contained in the dataset. The research reveals significant differences in walkability potential, both in spatial and temporal terms, and highlights gaps in nighttime service availability. The work presents an innovation on the 15 min city approach that highlights the impact of 24-h urban rhythms on real walkability outcomes. The quality limitations of the Google data are extensively explored in the article, providing further insight into the replicability and scalability of the methodology for future research."*

Using a checklist, it assessed the selected roads for pedestrian-friendly and hostile elements. Thirty participants residing near the roads were interviewed to understand their walking experiences and perceptions of street walkability. Findings reveal poor walking conditions on both roads, which lack essential pedestrian infrastructure. Where present, pedestrian infrastructure is often obstructed by businesses and parked vehicles. Respondents reported walking to be (severely) affected by conflicts with motorized traffic and especially motorcycles, and poor road conditions resulting in dust and mud in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Surprisingly, poor road conditions may also enhance walking, as they reduce vehicle speeds and thus safety risks.*
  - <b> Comparative Analysis of Residential Parking Questions in National Travel Surveys: A Cross-Country Study </b>  Marcel Porschen, Tobias Kuhnimhof // RWTH Aaachen: https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/9/1/3 - *Availability and utilization of residential parking locations remain a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of urban planning and policy making. Thus, this study investigates questions about residential parking within National Travel Surveys (NTS) across 49 OECD-affiliated countries. The study used a layered framework, differentiating parking locations by on/off-street, public/private access, proximity to dwellings, and infrastructure type to analyze questions and response options. A document review revealed significant variability in the inclusion of residential parking questions, with only 24 of 49 evaluated countries conducting NTS and only 15 explicitly addressing residential parking locations, often via one question. While questions are often similar, the response options are often ambiguous, sometimes misleading, and vary significantly. Based on the results, the study identifies the following recommendations: (1) adopt and rephrase parking-related questions in new and existing NTS, (2) provide guidance to users on how certain response options are defined, (3) for a more comprehensive understanding of residential parking dynamics, include a question on availability and actual usage, (4) add “National Travel Survey” as a keyword in applicable surveys, and (5) provide easy access to documentation to facilitate data retrieval and international comparison.*

  - <b> Accessibility, Car Dependence and Rural Peripheralization: The Automobility Gap in the Spanish Countryside </b> Jesus Oliva, Luís Camarero: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soru.12505 - *Disparities in access to opportunities and services often accumulate in peripheral rural areas, contributing to a sense of being left out of prosperity. To bridge this gap, regular commuting to cities where jobs and resources are concentrated has partly replaced emigration, making the private car the key to settling and living in the countryside. However, car dependency reveals important fractures within the rural population. This work examines the relationship between mobility capabilities and life opportunities by analysing the Spanish case. The results underscore the link between automobility deficits and the risk of exclusion. In a context where rural depopulation and gentrification, hypermobility and mobility deprivation coexist, car dependency needs to be addressed beyond a transport problem as a variable of social peripheralization. The conclusions highlight the need for rural policies to address the challenges posed by this issue in the current transitions to greener mobility paradigms and ageing societies.*

  - <b> Fossil fuel subsidy reform, distributive justice and civil unrest </b> Margherita Belgioioso, Edward Newman: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629624004596 - *This article explores how fossil fuel subsidy reform – widely regarded as being essential for reducing carbon emissions – may contribute to societal instability by generating grievances related to fuel insecurity and perceptions of unfair costs. The article explores the role that ‘distributive justice’ plays as a moderating factor in the relationship between reductions in fossil fuel subsidies and social unrest, based upon a new dataset combining data on fossil fuel subsidies, incidents of energy-related civil unrest, and measures of the equitable distribution of resources within society, covering the years 2015 to 2022. The article finds that fossil fuel subsidy reform increases social unrest in countries where distributive justice is lacking. Finally, the article explores the policy implications of these findings, suggesting that fuel subsidy reform should be accompanied by progressive social measures which not only protect the most vulnerable but also reflect the principle of ‘fairness’.*

Weak and volatile growth, high levels of poverty, near total energy import dependence, and a strong reliance on drought-prone agriculture are all symptoms of intrinsic structural vulnerabilities. Climate-smart development policies offer a pathway to address long-standing structural barriers to growth and accelerate convergence with European Union (EU) standards. Renewable energy and energy efficiency scale-up are crucial for improving the country’s energy security but will require substantial investments as well as full implementation of sectoral reforms to accelerate integration with EU energy markets. Adaptation investments are key, not only to manage the impacts of climate shocks, but also to raise productivity in the most vulnerable sectors. Most funding will need to come from the private sector, while public sector investments need to be substantially augmented by development partners. With smart macro-fiscal policies, Moldova has the opportunity and potential to implement these ambitious measures and lay the foundations for sustainable and resilient growth.*
