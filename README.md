  - <b> Unpacking mobility cultures: a review of conceptual definitions and empirical approaches </b> Dario Stolze,Thomas Klinger &Sonja Haustein: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2025.2454414#abstract - *While “Mobility Culture” is an emerging concept in transport science and policy, it is often defined and applied in different ways. The authors conducted a systematic literature review focusing on the definitions of the concept and how it has been approached empirically. It found that definitions of Mobility Culture are heterogeneous, often indirect and implicit, or missing entirely. We assigned papers to five definition groups based on similarity: (1) Objective and subjective characteristics, (2) subjective-only characteristics, (3) social groups and communities, (4) normative-sustainable notions of future transportation, and (5) papers lacking definitions. Among empirical papers, we identified three broader approaches: Comparative (e.g. city typologies or pre-and-post relocation studies), single-culture (e.g. place-specific mode choice, local discourses) and intervention studies.*
  - <b> Trip generation dynamics under the introduction of shared mobility </b> Vasiliki Kalliga, Santhanakrishnan Narayanan, Constantinos Antoniou: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692325000262 - *The travel behavior of individuals is significantly influenced by the built environment and travel facilities, impacting trip frequency, destination, and duration. This study aims to explore how these effects vary across different socioeconomic groups, particularly considering gender differences, and how individuals engage with state-of-the-art transport modes such as shared vehicles and bicycles during various stages of their life cycle.*
  - <b> The effect of ease of travel on travel behaviour and perceived accessibility: A focus on travel to university campus </b> Jonas De Vos, Long Cheng, Yuerong Zhang, 
Kailai Wang, Milad Mehdizadeh, Mengqiu Cao: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136984782500035X?via%3Dihub - *Ease of Travel (EoT), referring to people’s travel skills and motivations, and available travel options and quality can influence how people travel and how easily they can reach out-of-home activities. This study explores the new concept of EoT and analyse its underlying structures using a sample of 2,593 students and staff members of University College London (UK).*
  - <b> Day-to-day dynamics in two-sided ridesourcing markets </b> Arjan de Ruijter, Oded Cats, Hans van Lint // Delft University: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2024.2439987#d1e158 - *"To understand why ridesourcing markets may be prone to evolve towards potentially socially undesirable equilibrium states, we conceptualize the network effects present in ridesourcing provision. In addition, we propose an agent-based model that allows simulating the effect of market conditions and platform strategies on system performance, accounting for such network effects. This day-to-day model captures sequential decentralized processes characterizing both sides of the two-sided ridesourcing market, i.e. information diffusion, platform registration, platform participation, and learning based on experience. We apply the model on a case representing Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Our simulation results suggest that a profit-maximizing ridesourcing platform may trade-off market transaction volume for higher earnings on successful transactions, a strategy that is harmful to the interests of travellers and drivers, and possibly of (very) limited benefit to the platform."* 

- <b> Social issues </b>
  - <b> Productive exclusion: Accessibility inequalities and informal employment in Bogotá </b> Daniel Oviedo, Luis A. Guzmán, Nicolás Oviedo-Dávila: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718525000089?dgcid=coauthor - *Public transport provision has historically been biased against less affluent neighbourhoods, making access to jobs more costly and difficult for a substantial segment of the low(er)-income population. This research explores the distribution of accessibility to formal and informal employment in Bogotá, Colombia. Building on geocoded travel and household characterisation data for the city and potential accessibility metrics, it presents evidence of the contribution of public transport to social and spatial inequalities in accessibility for individuals in different spatial, economic, and social categories and the resulting mobility and accessibility inequalities such a distribution entails.* 
  - <b> Assessing justice in sustainable mobility transitions: narratives from transport policies in Jakarta </b> Isti Hidayati, Wendy Tan: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1523908X.2025.2452923#abstract - *This article proposes an analytic and evaluation framework for capturing different narratives of injustice resulting from three transport policies aiming for a sustainable mobility transition in Jakarta: (1) traffic restriction policy, (2) integrated public transport, and (3) improvement of walking and cycling infrastructures. Using content analysis of news media to identify how these policies are perceived by and affect various segments of the population, the findings revealed that a broader scope of injustice is experienced by the low-income populace, including those with ‘forced’ motorcycle ownership and captive public transport users.*
  - <b> Addressing Barriers to Women’s Participation in Transport : Global, ECA, and MENA Perspectives </b> World Bank: https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099010925132542721/pdf/P506086186091904719bd91942a8efc6448.pdf - *This report explores the key challenges to women’s employment in the transport sector and provides recommendations for how stakeholders can tackle gender gaps and increase women’s representation in the workforce, with a particular focus on skilled technical and managerial roles.

- <b> Urban mobility </b>
  - <b> The Right to the Night City: Exploring the Temporal Variability of the 15-min City in Milan and Its Implications for Nocturnal Communities </b> Lamia Abdelfattah, Abubakr Albashir, Giulia Ceccarelli, Andrea Gorrini,Federico Messa, Dante Presicce: https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/14/1/22 - *"The needs of night communities and the barriers they face in accessing diverse urban amenities are underexplored in urban planning research. Focus is primarily given to the needs of cultural consumers, frequently overlooking the challenges faced by regular nighttime communities, including night workers. Through a GIS-based analysis, the aim of this research is to shed light on differences in accessibility to core urban services between day and night in the city of Milan. The spatiotemporal analysis was performed using a customized version of the 15-min City Score Toolkit, an open-source, Python-based proprietary tool developed to automate the 15 min access metric estimation. Proprietary Point-Of-Interest (POI) data that were retrieved, sorted and filtered from the Google Places API are used to simulate time-variant walkability maps based on opening hour information contained in the dataset. The research reveals significant differences in walkability potential, both in spatial and temporal terms, and highlights gaps in nighttime service availability. The work presents an innovation on the 15 min city approach that highlights the impact of 24-h urban rhythms on real walkability outcomes. The quality limitations of the Google data are extensively explored in the article, providing further insight into the replicability and scalability of the methodology for future research."*
  - <b> Designing a robust and cost-efficient electrified bus network with sparse energy consumption data </b> Sara Momen, Yousef Maknoon, Bart van Arem, 
Shadi Sharif Azadeh: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X25000245?via%3Dihub - *This paper addresses the challenges of charging infrastructure design (CID) for electrified public transport networks using Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) under conditions of sparse energy consumption data. Accurate energy consumption estimation is critical for cost-effective and reliable electrification but often requires costly field experiments, resulting in limited data.*
  - <b> How would employees commute today if they had the same characteristics as employees in 1980? – Using entropy balancing to decompose changes in observed commuting mode choice over time in repeated cross-sections </b> Nicole Reinfeld, Tobias Hagen: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096585642400418X?via%3Dihub - *In recent decades, societal, economic, and technological developments have altered commuting behavior in many European and North American regions. Understanding the reasons for observed changes in commuting mode choice is crucial to implementing effective transport policy measures. Changes in commuting mode choice stem from either changing observable characteristics (structure of the population) or variables that are often unobserved for the researcher (such as prices or attitudes). This study contributes to the literature by applying Entropy Balancing for the first time to decompose changes in commuting mode choice over time.*

  - <b> Public transport: Status and research priorities for Latin America and the Caribbean </b> Ricardo Giesen, Darío Hidalgo, Raúl Ramos: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950024925000022 - *The review indicates that researchers in the LAC region have concentrated on researching public transport reforms, on social aspects, like accessibility, equity, and inclusion, on demand, behavior, and user perceptions of public transport, on emissions, externalities, and new technologies. This review suggests that multiple aspects require further analysis to improve quality of public transport services and reduce social, environmental, and financial impacts.*
  - <b> Urban roads and walking: Exploring pedestrian perceptions and experiences in a Sub-Saharan African City </b> Polycap Chesifu Chebe, Lawrence F. Fombe, 
Karel Martens: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950196225000018 - *The study analyzes residents' perceptions and experiences on two distinct roads in Bamenda, the third-largest city in Cameroon. Using a checklist, it assessed the selected roads for pedestrian-friendly and hostile elements. Thirty participants residing near the roads were interviewed to understand their walking experiences and perceptions of street walkability. Findings reveal poor walking conditions on both roads, which lack essential pedestrian infrastructure. Where present, pedestrian infrastructure is often obstructed by businesses and parked vehicles. Respondents reported walking to be (severely) affected by conflicts with motorized traffic and especially motorcycles, and poor road conditions resulting in dust and mud in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Surprisingly, poor road conditions may also enhance walking, as they reduce vehicle speeds and thus safety risks.*
  - <b> Comparative Analysis of Residential Parking Questions in National Travel Surveys: A Cross-Country Study </b>  Marcel Porschen, Tobias Kuhnimhof // RWTH Aaachen: https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/9/1/3 - *Availability and utilization of residential parking locations remain a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of urban planning and policy making. Thus, this study investigates questions about residential parking within National Travel Surveys (NTS) across 49 OECD-affiliated countries. The study used a layered framework, differentiating parking locations by on/off-street, public/private access, proximity to dwellings, and infrastructure type to analyze questions and response options. A document review revealed significant variability in the inclusion of residential parking questions, with only 24 of 49 evaluated countries conducting NTS and only 15 explicitly addressing residential parking locations, often via one question. While questions are often similar, the response options are often ambiguous, sometimes misleading, and vary significantly. Based on the results, the study identifies the following recommendations: (1) adopt and rephrase parking-related questions in new and existing NTS, (2) provide guidance to users on how certain response options are defined, (3) for a more comprehensive understanding of residential parking dynamics, include a question on availability and actual usage, (4) add “National Travel Survey” as a keyword in applicable surveys, and (5) provide easy access to documentation to facilitate data retrieval and international comparison.*

  - <b> Transforming Catalonia’s Mobility System for Net Zero </b> OECD: https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/transforming-catalonia-s-mobility-system-for-net-zero_1cac3681-en/full-report.html - *Guided by the 3 steps of the OECD Systems Innovation for Net Zero process, this report takes a systems approach to identify processes and policy packages able to trigger behavioural change in favour of sustainable modes to reduce emissions while improving well-being in the land passenger transport sector in the region. The term behavioural change is intrinsically linked to the insight from complexity science that individual preferences – and the resulting patterns of behaviour observed over time – are largely determined by the structure of the system in which they are embedded.*
  - <b> Governing mobility hubs in the sustainable urban mobility transition: Dynamics of stability and change </b> Julia Hansel: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X25000320?via%3Dihub - *To date, academic literature on mobility hubs and multimodality has predominantly focused on design and user needs, integration into urban space, and environmental impact. In contrast, this article asks how the governance framework affects the implementation of mobility hub networks. The theoretical approach combines an analysis of governance arrangements with literature on smart mobility governance. This multifaceted analytical framework facilitates the examination of various dimensions and dynamics of the governance arrangements behind mobility hubs.*

  - <b> Accessibility, Car Dependence and Rural Peripheralization: The Automobility Gap in the Spanish Countryside </b> Jesus Oliva, Luís Camarero: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soru.12505 - *Disparities in access to opportunities and services often accumulate in peripheral rural areas, contributing to a sense of being left out of prosperity. To bridge this gap, regular commuting to cities where jobs and resources are concentrated has partly replaced emigration, making the private car the key to settling and living in the countryside. However, car dependency reveals important fractures within the rural population. This work examines the relationship between mobility capabilities and life opportunities by analysing the Spanish case. The results underscore the link between automobility deficits and the risk of exclusion. In a context where rural depopulation and gentrification, hypermobility and mobility deprivation coexist, car dependency needs to be addressed beyond a transport problem as a variable of social peripheralization. The conclusions highlight the need for rural policies to address the challenges posed by this issue in the current transitions to greener mobility paradigms and ageing societies.*
  - <b> Health Impacts of Low-carbon Transport in Cities </b> ITF: https://www.itf-oecd.org/health-impacts-low-carbon-transport-cities - *This report promotes a transition to low-carbon mobility that prioritises environmental goals and human well-being. By evaluating low-carbon policy scenarios, the report offers evidence-based recommendations for policy makers to integrate health into transport and urban planning. It features insights to invest in active and public transport infrastructure and equity-centred approaches to urban development. It is a roadmap for creating sustainable cities that are healthier, safer, and more inclusive.*
  - <b> Three-dimensional transport poverty and its socio-demographic and urban density predictors: Spatial regression analyses of neighborhoods in the Amsterdam metropolitan area </b> Thijs Bon, Matthew Bruno, Niels van Oort: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198225000193?via%3Dihub - *This study investigates the relevance of socio-demographic and urban density predictors in relation to transport poverty contributor metrics for neighborhoods in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. Utilizing a spatial econometric framework, it assess the relevance of these predictors across three dimensions of transport poverty: mobility, accessibility, and affordability. Contrary to existing literature, our findings indicate that the demographic factors of gender and younger age are not significant predictors at the neighborhood level. Furthermore, the research identified a correlation between higher urban density and transport poverty.*
  - <b> Fossil fuel subsidy reform, distributive justice and civil unrest </b> Margherita Belgioioso, Edward Newman: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629624004596 - *This article explores how fossil fuel subsidy reform – widely regarded as being essential for reducing carbon emissions – may contribute to societal instability by generating grievances related to fuel insecurity and perceptions of unfair costs. The article explores the role that ‘distributive justice’ plays as a moderating factor in the relationship between reductions in fossil fuel subsidies and social unrest, based upon a new dataset combining data on fossil fuel subsidies, incidents of energy-related civil unrest, and measures of the equitable distribution of resources within society, covering the years 2015 to 2022. The article finds that fossil fuel subsidy reform increases social unrest in countries where distributive justice is lacking. Finally, the article explores the policy implications of these findings, suggesting that fuel subsidy reform should be accompanied by progressive social measures which not only protect the most vulnerable but also reflect the principle of ‘fairness’.*
  - <b> Women Behind the Wheels: Gendered Nature of Transport-Based Gig Work in South Asia </b> Safetipin, Women Mobilize Women: https://transformative-mobility.org/multimedia/women-behind-the-wheels-gendered-nature-of-transport-based-gig-work-in-south-asia/ - *The gig economy, once niche, has expanded rapidly, reshaping work structures. While it offers flexible opportunities, especially for women, its promise remains largely unrealized in South Asia’s transport sector. While gig work platforms multiplied tenfold between 2007 and 2020, women’s involvement remains low, especially in the Global South from where 80% of the revenue is generated. Safetipin, supported by GIZ through Women Mobilize Women, has undertaken secondary research to identify barriers women face in entering and thriving in the transport-based gig economy across five South Asian countries— India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.*

  - <b> Moldova Country Climate and Development Report </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/b5886ecd-d46b-4d48-a747-19e9326e0e9d - *Moldova’s climate and development challenges are inextricably linked. Weak and volatile growth, high levels of poverty, near total energy import dependence, and a strong reliance on drought-prone agriculture are all symptoms of intrinsic structural vulnerabilities. Climate-smart development policies offer a pathway to address long-standing structural barriers to growth and accelerate convergence with European Union (EU) standards. Renewable energy and energy efficiency scale-up are crucial for improving the country’s energy security but will require substantial investments as well as full implementation of sectoral reforms to accelerate integration with EU energy markets. Adaptation investments are key, not only to manage the impacts of climate shocks, but also to raise productivity in the most vulnerable sectors. Most funding will need to come from the private sector, while public sector investments need to be substantially augmented by development partners. With smart macro-fiscal policies, Moldova has the opportunity and potential to implement these ambitious measures and lay the foundations for sustainable and resilient growth.*

  - <b> How well does the 3–30–300 rule mitigate urban flooding? </b> Gianni Vesuviano, Alice Fitch, Danial Owen, David Fletcher, Laurence Jones: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161886672400459X - *The 3–30–300 rule is a new guideline for urban forestry and urban greening, which is rapidly gaining interest among city planners, international organizations and NGOs. However, the ecosystem service benefits of this new guideline have not been quantified and there has been no research to date on how implementing the 3–30–300 rule may mitigate urban flooding. The study findsthat the creation of new green spaces and tree cover can greatly reduce peak pluvial surface runoff rate at-site, and maintain peak flow reductions of several percent in sub-catchments of several square kilometres, including reductions of over 10 % in some sub-catchments of over 20 km2 in Paris.*

  - <b> CO2 emission standards to achieve Mexico’s 2030 electrification target for light-duty vehicles </b> Tanzila Khan, Carlos Jimenez, Leticia Pineda, Zifei Yang, Josh Miller, and Arijit Sen // ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/co2-emission-standards-to-achieve-mexicos-2030-electrification-target-for-ldvs-jan25/ - *The report suggests that the currently adopted Phase 2 standards will not be sufficient to achieve Mexico’s climate and electrification goals. Furthermore, these standards could potentially drive increase in gCO2/km emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Such increase in ICE emissions can lead to 108 million tonnes additional cumulative emissions during 2024-2050, compared to business-as-usual level.*

In addition to policies in the Baseline scenarios designed in previous studies (Baseline 2021 and Baseline 2023), it evaluates three updated scenarios: a Baseline 2024 scenario incorporating policies adopted through August 2024, a Momentum scenario that includes additional proposed policies and targets, and an Ambitious scenario aligned with Paris Agreement goals. The analysis reveals how recent policy developments have substantially increased projected ZEV uptake and provides insights into remaining gaps with a Paris-compatible emissions trajectory.*

Eva Malichová, Manuel Ojeda-Cabral: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856424003847 - *The concept of worthwhile travel time (WTT, Cornet et al., 2022) provides insight into how travellers perceive their travel time. Worthwhileness can be linked to multiple domains, including enjoyment, fitness, and productivity. This study leverages the full open dataset collected by the Woorti app, comprising 38,838 validated trip legs in 8 countries, to empirically substantiate the WTT concept across walking, cycling, public transport, and private motorised travel.* - see alos: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2021.1983067
