  - <b> Urban Transport State of Play Presentations </b> Asian Transport Observatory: https://asiantransportobservatory.org/analytical-outputs/urban-state-of-play-presentations/ - *Urban State of Play presentations give an overview of the transport sector in the concerned urban center by presenting historic trends as well as outlooks in some cases for key topics covered by the ATO such as transport infrastructure, activity and services, access and connectivity, road safety, climate change, air pollution and economic impact of the transport sector. Apart from data the State of Play presentations also give an overview of existing policies, relevant targets and policy instruments* New:

  - <b> Unpacking mobility cultures: a review of conceptual definitions and empirical approaches </b> Dario Stolze,Thomas Klinger &Sonja Haustein: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2025.2454414#abstract - *While “Mobility Culture” is an emerging concept in transport science and policy, it is often defined and applied in different ways. The authors conducted a systematic literature review focusing on the definitions of the concept and how it has been approached empirically. It found that definitions of Mobility Culture are heterogeneous, often indirect and implicit, or missing entirely. We assigned papers to five definition groups based on similarity: (1) Objective and subjective characteristics, (2) subjective-only characteristics, (3) social groups and communities, (4) normative-sustainable notions of future transportation, and (5) papers lacking definitions. Among empirical papers, we identified three broader approaches: Comparative (e.g. city typologies or pre-and-post relocation studies), single-culture (e.g. place-specific mode choice, local discourses) and intervention studies.*
  - <b> Trip generation dynamics under the introduction of shared mobility </b> Vasiliki Kalliga, Santhanakrishnan Narayanan, Constantinos Antoniou: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692325000262 - *The travel behavior of individuals is significantly influenced by the built environment and travel facilities, impacting trip frequency, destination, and duration. This study aims to explore how these effects vary across different socioeconomic groups, particularly considering gender differences, and how individuals engage with state-of-the-art transport modes such as shared vehicles and bicycles during various stages of their life cycle.*
  - <b> The effect of ease of travel on travel behaviour and perceived accessibility: A focus on travel to university campus </b> Jonas De Vos, Long Cheng, Yuerong Zhang, 
Kailai Wang, Milad Mehdizadeh, Mengqiu Cao: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136984782500035X?via%3Dihub - *Ease of Travel (EoT), referring to people’s travel skills and motivations, and available travel options and quality can influence how people travel and how easily they can reach out-of-home activities. This study explores the new concept of EoT and analyse its underlying structures using a sample of 2,593 students and staff members of University College London (UK).*
  - <b> Day-to-day dynamics in two-sided ridesourcing markets </b> Arjan de Ruijter, Oded Cats, Hans van Lint // Delft University: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2024.2439987#d1e158 - *"To understand why ridesourcing markets may be prone to evolve towards potentially socially undesirable equilibrium states, we conceptualize the network effects present in ridesourcing provision. In addition, we propose an agent-based model that allows simulating the effect of market conditions and platform strategies on system performance, accounting for such network effects. This day-to-day model captures sequential decentralized processes characterizing both sides of the two-sided ridesourcing market, i.e. information diffusion, platform registration, platform participation, and learning based on experience. We apply the model on a case representing Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Our simulation results suggest that a profit-maximizing ridesourcing platform may trade-off market transaction volume for higher earnings on successful transactions, a strategy that is harmful to the interests of travellers and drivers, and possibly of (very) limited benefit to the platform."*
  - <b> Ambiguity in state-owned land property rights increases transaction costs in China’s transit-oriented development projects </b> Dongsheng He, Jinshuo Wang, , 
Guibo Sun: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837725000341 - *"This paper provides compelling evidence that the ambiguity in state-owned land property rights increases transaction costs in China’s transit-oriented development (TOD) projects. The constitution defines the state as the de jure (legally defined) owner of urban land, but tiers of local government share the de facto (practically controlled) land property rights; this ambiguity complicates land use right transfer for TOD. Through expert interviews, document analysis, and case studies in Guangzhou, we identified three critical issues. First, ambiguity in de facto land property rights has led district governments to relocate the metro depot site from a profitable plot suitable for metro scheduling and property development to land plots that are less advantageous and far away from the station. Second, the coexistence of land allocation and leasing approaches under state ownership discouraged an optimised land assembly for the TOD project. Rigid acquisition sizes designated in land allocation for infrastructure discouraged coordination and prolonged negotiations between the district government and the metro company. Finally, the district government faced a disproportionate fiscal responsibility compared to their land leasing share from the municipal government."*
- <b> Questioning mobility as a service: Unanticipated implications for society and governance </b> Kate Pangbourne, Miloš N. Mladenović, Dominic Stead, Dimitris Milakis: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418309601?via%3Dihub - *"In this paper we focus on the development of a new service model for accessing transport, namely Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and present one of the first critical analyses of the rhetoric surrounding the concept. One central assumption of one prevalent MaaS conceptualization is that transport services are bundled into service packages for monthly payment, as in the telecommunication or media service sectors."
- <b> High Volume Transport Applied Research Programme: Compendium </b> HVT // FCDO: https://transport-links.com/hvt-publications/high-volume-transport-applied-research-programme-compendium - *"The High Volume Transport Applied Research Programme (HVT) provides a new body of research focused on Africa and South Asia, to help inform the decisions of policy-makers and planners and make road and rail transport greener, safer and more accessible, affordable and inclusive and to ultimately make good investment decisions that will help drive economic and social development. This compendium highlights this new body of research. Through our core themes we explore the outcomes of research and share key insights that have progressed knowledge in transport in Africa and South Asia. The full list of research outputs and links to further reading are in the back of this report."*
