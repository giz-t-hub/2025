- <b> CO2 emission standards to achieve Mexico’s 2030 electrification target for light-duty vehicles </b> Tanzila Khan, Carlos Jimenez, Leticia Pineda, Zifei Yang, Josh Miller, and Arijit Sen // ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/co2-emission-standards-to-achieve-mexicos-2030-electrification-target-for-ldvs-jan25/ - *The report suggests that the currently adopted Phase 2 standards will not be sufficient to achieve Mexico’s climate and electrification goals. Furthermore, these standards could potentially drive increase in gCO2/km emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Such increase in ICE emissions can lead to 108 million tonnes additional cumulative emissions during 2024-2050, compared to business-as-usual level.*
- <b> Vision 2050: Update on the global zero-emission vehicle transition in 2024 </b>  Arijit Sen, Jacob Teter, and Josh Miller / ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/vision-2050-global-zev-transition-2024-jan25/ - *This study updates the annual ICCT assessment of global ZEV policies and market developments, analyzing their impact on projected vehicle sales, energy consumption, and emissions through 2050. In addition to policies in the Baseline scenarios designed in previous studies (Baseline 2021 and Baseline 2023), it evaluates three updated scenarios: a Baseline 2024 scenario incorporating policies adopted through August 2024, a Momentum scenario that includes additional proposed policies and targets, and an Ambitious scenario aligned with Paris Agreement goals. The analysis reveals how recent policy developments have substantially increased projected ZEV uptake and provides insights into remaining gaps with a Paris-compatible emissions trajectory.*

- <b> European clean tech tracker </b> Simone Tagliapietra, Ben McWilliams, Cecilia Trasi, Ugnė Keliauskaitė, Marie Jugé //Bruegel: https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-clean-tech-tracker - *This tracker provides an overview of the main innovation, manufacturing and deployment trends in clean tech in Europe*
- <b> A quantitative urban model for transport appraisal </b> Daniel Hörcher, Daniel J. Graham, ICL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5067099 -*This paper builds upon the methodological principles of quantitative spatial economics, an emerging eld within the spatial economics literature, to design an appraisal method that captures the interactions between transport supply and the labour, production and real estate markets.*
