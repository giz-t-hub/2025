- <b> Urban roads and walking: Exploring pedestrian perceptions and experiences in a Sub-Saharan African City </b> Polycap Chesifu Chebe, Lawrence F. Fombe, , 
Karel Martens: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950196225000018 - *The study analyzes residents' perceptions and experiences on two distinct roads in Bamenda, the third-largest city in Cameroon. Using a checklist, it assessed the selected roads for pedestrian-friendly and hostile elements. Thirty participants residing near the roads were interviewed to understand their walking experiences and perceptions of street walkability. Findings reveal poor walking conditions on both roads, which lack essential pedestrian infrastructure. Where present, pedestrian infrastructure is often obstructed by businesses and parked vehicles. Respondents reported walking to be (severely) affected by conflicts with motorized traffic and especially motorcycles, and poor road conditions resulting in dust and mud in dry and rainy seasons respectively. Surprisingly, poor road conditions may also enhance walking, as they reduce vehicle speeds and thus safety risks.*
- <b> Comparative Analysis of Residential Parking Questions in National Travel Surveys: A Cross-Country Study </b>  Marcel Porschen, Tobias Kuhnimhof // RWTH Aaachen: https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/9/1/3 - *Availability and utilization of residential parking locations remain a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of urban planning and policy making. Thus, this study investigates questions about residential parking within National Travel Surveys (NTS) across 49 OECD-affiliated countries. The study used a layered framework, differentiating parking locations by on/off-street, public/private access, proximity to dwellings, and infrastructure type to analyze questions and response options. A document review revealed significant variability in the inclusion of residential parking questions, with only 24 of 49 evaluated countries conducting NTS and only 15 explicitly addressing residential parking locations, often via one question. While questions are often similar, the response options are often ambiguous, sometimes misleading, and vary significantly. Based on the results, the study identifies the following recommendations: (1) adopt and rephrase parking-related questions in new and existing NTS, (2) provide guidance to users on how certain response options are defined, (3) for a more comprehensive understanding of residential parking dynamics, include a question on availability and actual usage, (4) add “National Travel Survey” as a keyword in applicable surveys, and (5) provide easy access to documentation to facilitate data retrieval and international comparison.*
- <b> Accessibility, Car Dependence and Rural Peripheralization: The Automobility Gap in the Spanish Countryside </b> Jesus Oliva, Luís Camarero: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/soru.12505 - *Disparities in access to opportunities and services often accumulate in peripheral rural areas, contributing to a sense of being left out of prosperity. To bridge this gap, regular commuting to cities where jobs and resources are concentrated has partly replaced emigration, making the private car the key to settling and living in the countryside. However, car dependency reveals important fractures within the rural population. This work examines the relationship between mobility capabilities and life opportunities by analysing the Spanish case. The results underscore the link between automobility deficits and the risk of exclusion. In a context where rural depopulation and gentrification, hypermobility and mobility deprivation coexist, car dependency needs to be addressed beyond a transport problem as a variable of social peripheralization. The conclusions highlight the need for rural policies to address the challenges posed by this issue in the current transitions to greener mobility paradigms and ageing societies.*
- <b> How well does the 3–30–300 rule mitigate urban flooding? </b> Gianni Vesuviano, Alice Fitch, Danial Owen, David Fletcher, Laurence Jones: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S161886672400459X - *The 3–30–300 rule is a new guideline for urban forestry and urban greening, which is rapidly gaining interest among city planners, international organizations and NGOs. However, the ecosystem service benefits of this new guideline have not been quantified and there has been no research to date on how implementing the 3–30–300 rule may mitigate urban flooding. The study findsthat the creation of new green spaces and tree cover can greatly reduce peak pluvial surface runoff rate at-site, and maintain peak flow reductions of several percent in sub-catchments of several square kilometres, including reductions of over 10 % in some sub-catchments of over 20 km2 in Paris.*
- <b> World Economic Situation and Prospects 2025 </b> UNCTAD: https://unctad.org/publication/world-economic-situation-and-prospects-2025 - *The 2025 edition of the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects report comes at the mid-way point of a decade that has been characterized by economic turbulence. This report shows that the global economy is finally recovering following a sequence of shocks.*
- <b> Point Based System for Assessing Passenger Level of Service at Public Transport Terminals: A Railway Case Study </b> Sudhanshu Pawar, Anantakrishnan Tandyekkal, , 
Hari Krishna Gaddam: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146524004526 - *This study emphasises on calculating the passenger level of service (P-LOS) of a railway station using point-based system which takes qualitative and quantitative factors into account. With the proposed method, points for the potential factors were given by passengers through a questionnaire survey was considered for the analysis.*
- <b> Health Impacts of Low-carbon Transport in Cities </b> ITF: https://www.itf-oecd.org/health-impacts-low-carbon-transport-cities - *This report promotes a transition to low-carbon mobility that prioritises environmental goals and human well-being. By evaluating low-carbon policy scenarios, the report offers evidence-based recommendations for policy makers to integrate health into transport and urban planning. It features insights to invest in active and public transport infrastructure and equity-centred approaches to urban development. It is a roadmap for creating sustainable cities that are healthier, safer, and more inclusive.*
- <b> Fuel cells: A technical, environmental, and economic outlook </b> Ilham Sebbani, Mohammed Karim Ettouhami, Mouaad Boulakhbar: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772783124000621?via%3Dihub  - *In the pursuit of establishing a sustainable fuel cell (FC) energy system, this review highlights the necessity of examining the operational principles, technical details, environmental consequences, and economic concerns collectively. By adopting an integrated approach, the review research into various fuel cells types, extending their applications beyond transportation and evaluating their potential for seamless integration into sustainable practices. A detailed analysis of the technical aspects, including FC membranes, performance, and applications, is presented.* 
- <b> Who is willing to take transit in the future? Older adults’ perceived challenges and barriers to using public transit across Canada </b> Meredith Alousi-Jones, Thiago Carvalho, Merrina Zhang, Isabella Jimenez, Ahmed El-Geneidy: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856425000047 - *Based on the Aging in Place survey conducted in March 2023 (N = 3,551), this research explores the barriers preventing older Canadians (65 and older) from using public transit in their area of residence.* 
- <b> How Experiments Can Contribute to the Responsible Design of the Local Mobility Transition </b> *(Wie Experimente zur verantwortungsvollen Gestaltung der kommunalen Mobilitätswende beitragen können)* Dr. Franziska X. Meinherz, Dr. Michael Mögele, Jana Heese, Manuel Jung, Dr. Stefanie Ruf, Dr. Alexander Wentland, Technische Universität München: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ugcPost-7291119140692529152-Ilsw - *The article demonstrates that experiments, in particular, enable a constructive approach to implementation conflicts. With their flexibility, short-term feasibility, and cost-effectiveness, they can complement and enhance the design of long-term infrastructure measures and projects.*
- <b> Transforming Catalonia’s Mobility System for Net Zero </b> OECD: https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/transforming-catalonia-s-mobility-system-for-net-zero_1cac3681-en/full-report.html - *Guided by the 3 steps of the OECD Systems Innovation for Net Zero process, this report takes a systems approach to identify processes and policy packages able to trigger behavioural change in favour of sustainable modes to reduce emissions while improving well-being in the land passenger transport sector in the region. The term behavioural change is intrinsically linked to the insight from complexity science that individual preferences – and the resulting patterns of behaviour observed over time – are largely determined by the structure of the system in which they are embedded.*
- <b> Pathways for Low-Carbon Transition in Bangladesh 2025–2050 </b> ADB: https://www.adb.org/publications/pathways-low-carbon-transition-bangladesh - *This report examines business-as-usual and low-carbon scenarios for Bangladesh at the national level and Dhaka at the city level. It outlines the technologies, efficiency measures, and investment costs associated with the low-carbon transition in the country for 2025–2050.*
- <b> Three-dimensional transport poverty and its socio-demographic and urban density predictors: Spatial regression analyses of neighborhoods in the Amsterdam metropolitan area </b> Thijs Bon, Matthew Bruno, Niels van Oort: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198225000193?via%3Dihub - *This study investigates the relevance of socio-demographic and urban density predictors in relation to transport poverty contributor metrics for neighborhoods in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. Utilizing a spatial econometric framework, it assess the relevance of these predictors across three dimensions of transport poverty: mobility, accessibility, and affordability. Contrary to existing literature, our findings indicate that the demographic factors of gender and younger age are not significant predictors at the neighborhood level. Furthermore, the research identified a correlation between higher urban density and transport poverty.*
- <b> Fossil fuel subsidy reform, distributive justice and civil unrest </b> Margherita Belgioioso, Edward Newman: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629624004596 - *This article explores how fossil fuel subsidy reform – widely regarded as being essential for reducing carbon emissions – may contribute to societal instability by generating grievances related to fuel insecurity and perceptions of unfair costs. The article explores the role that ‘distributive justice’ plays as a moderating factor in the relationship between reductions in fossil fuel subsidies and social unrest, based upon a new dataset combining data on fossil fuel subsidies, incidents of energy-related civil unrest, and measures of the equitable distribution of resources within society, covering the years 2015 to 2022. The article finds that fossil fuel subsidy reform increases social unrest in countries where distributive justice is lacking. Finally, the article explores the policy implications of these findings, suggesting that fuel subsidy reform should be accompanied by progressive social measures which not only protect the most vulnerable but also reflect the principle of ‘fairness’.*
- <b> Women Behind the Wheels: Gendered Nature of Transport-Based Gig Work in South Asia </b> Safetipin, Women Mobilize Women: https://transformative-mobility.org/multimedia/women-behind-the-wheels-gendered-nature-of-transport-based-gig-work-in-south-asia/ - *The gig economy, once niche, has expanded rapidly, reshaping work structures. While it offers flexible opportunities, especially for women, its promise remains largely unrealized in South Asia’s transport sector. While gig work platforms multiplied tenfold between 2007 and 2020, women’s involvement remains low, especially in the Global South from where 80% of the revenue is generated. Safetipin, supported by GIZ through Women Mobilize Women, has undertaken secondary research to identify barriers women face in entering and thriving in the transport-based gig economy across five South Asian countries— India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.*
- <b> Community Bike Workshops in Australia: Increasing Demand for Cycling Through Mutual Aid </b> Simon Batterburya, Carlos Uxob, Margot Abord de Chatillonc, Stephen Nursed: https://tots.upol.cz/corproof.php?tartkey=tot-000000-0566 - *In this article analyses a small but growing movement of community bike workshops or ‘bike kitchens’ in Australia*
- <b> Governing mobility hubs in the sustainable urban mobility transition: Dynamics of stability and change </b> Julia Hansel: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X25000320?via%3Dihub - *To date, academic literature on mobility hubs and multimodality has predominantly focused on design and user needs, integration into urban space, and environmental impact. In contrast, this article asks how the governance framework affects the implementation of mobility hub networks. The theoretical approach combines an analysis of governance arrangements with literature on smart mobility governance. This multifaceted analytical framework facilitates the examination of various dimensions and dynamics of the governance arrangements behind mobility hubs.*

Meta Berghauser Pont, Gianna Stavroulaki // Chalmers University of Technology: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387824131_The_configurational_dimension_in_street_design_guidelines_Findings_from_a_systematic_review_of_international_street_design_guidelines - *The paper presents the systematic review of 48 international street design guidelines and identifies identifying gaps in the way street design guidelines address the configurational dimension of streets.*
- <b> Passenger and freight transport trends compared around the world </b> ITF: https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/passenger-freight-transport-trends-statistics-brief.pdf - *Road freight transport has been steadily gaining ground on other inland transport modes in most countries, based on the latest update of ITF’s Annual Trends in the Transport Sector data. A ten-year comparison reveals that 24 of the 27 countries reporting data saw a relative increase in road transport between 2013 and 2023.* 
- <b> CO2 emission standards to achieve Mexico’s 2030 electrification target for light-duty vehicles </b> Tanzila Khan, Carlos Jimenez, Leticia Pineda, Zifei Yang, Josh Miller, and Arijit Sen // ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/co2-emission-standards-to-achieve-mexicos-2030-electrification-target-for-ldvs-jan25/ - *The report suggests that the currently adopted Phase 2 standards will not be sufficient to achieve Mexico’s climate and electrification goals. Furthermore, these standards could potentially drive increase in gCO2/km emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Such increase in ICE emissions can lead to 108 million tonnes additional cumulative emissions during 2024-2050, compared to business-as-usual level.*
- <b> Vision 2050: Update on the global zero-emission vehicle transition in 2024 </b>  Arijit Sen, Jacob Teter, and Josh Miller / ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/vision-2050-global-zev-transition-2024-jan25/ - *This study updates the annual ICCT assessment of global ZEV policies and market developments, analyzing their impact on projected vehicle sales, energy consumption, and emissions through 2050. In addition to policies in the Baseline scenarios designed in previous studies (Baseline 2021 and Baseline 2023), it evaluates three updated scenarios: a Baseline 2024 scenario incorporating policies adopted through August 2024, a Momentum scenario that includes additional proposed policies and targets, and an Ambitious scenario aligned with Paris Agreement goals. The analysis reveals how recent policy developments have substantially increased projected ZEV uptake and provides insights into remaining gaps with a Paris-compatible emissions trajectory.*
