- <b> Women Behind the Wheels: Gendered Nature of Transport-Based Gig Work in South Asia </b> Safetipin, Women Mobilize Women: https://transformative-mobility.org/multimedia/women-behind-the-wheels-gendered-nature-of-transport-based-gig-work-in-south-asia/ - *The gig economy, once niche, has expanded rapidly, reshaping work structures. While it offers flexible opportunities, especially for women, its promise remains largely unrealized in South Asia’s transport sector. While gig work platforms multiplied tenfold between 2007 and 2020, women’s involvement remains low, especially in the Global South from where 80% of the revenue is generated. Safetipin, supported by GIZ through Women Mobilize Women, has undertaken secondary research to identify barriers women face in entering and thriving in the transport-based gig economy across five South Asian countries— India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.*
- <b> Community Bike Workshops in Australia: Increasing Demand for Cycling Through Mutual Aid </b> Simon Batterburya, Carlos Uxob, Margot Abord de Chatillonc, Stephen Nursed: https://tots.upol.cz/corproof.php?tartkey=tot-000000-0566 - *In this article analyses a small but growing movement of community bike workshops or ‘bike kitchens’ in Australia*
- <b> Governing mobility hubs in the sustainable urban mobility transition: Dynamics of stability and change </b> Julia Hansel: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X25000320?via%3Dihub - *To date, academic literature on mobility hubs and multimodality has predominantly focused on design and user needs, integration into urban space, and environmental impact. In contrast, this article asks how the governance framework affects the implementation of mobility hub networks. The theoretical approach combines an analysis of governance arrangements with literature on smart mobility governance. This multifaceted analytical framework facilitates the examination of various dimensions and dynamics of the governance arrangements behind mobility hubs.* 
- <b>Planning Framework for Low Emission Zone (LEZ) in Core Areas of Indian Cities – Final Report</b> Published by High Volume Transport (HVT), January 2025, https://transport-links.com/hvt-publications/planning-framework-for-low-emission-zone-lez-in-core-areas-of-indian-cities-final-report - *This report provides a strategic framework for implementing Low Emission Zones (LEZ) in Indian cities, focusing on air quality improvement, congestion reduction, and sustainable urban mobility*
- <b> A Step–by–Step Guide for Planning and Designing of Street Vending in Indian Cities </b> Manvita Baradi, Meghna Malhotra // Urban Management Center India: https://umcasia.org/wp-content/uploads/A-Step-by-Step-Guide-for-Planning-and-Designing-of-Street-Vending-in-Indian-Cities_03012025.pdf - *This guide provides insightful strategies for thoughtfully planning street vending spaces, supporting livelihoods, and promoting equity in urban areas in India.*   
- <b> The configurational dimension in street design guidelines. Findings from a systematic review of international street design guidelines </b> Evgeniya Bobkova, 
Meta Berghauser Pont, Gianna Stavroulaki // Chalmers University of Technology: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387824131_The_configurational_dimension_in_street_design_guidelines_Findings_from_a_systematic_review_of_international_street_design_guidelines - *The paper presents the systematic review of 48 international street design guidelines and identifies identifying gaps in the way street design guidelines address the configurational dimension of streets.*
- <b> Passenger and freight transport trends compared around the world </b> ITF: https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/passenger-freight-transport-trends-statistics-brief.pdf - *Road freight transport has been steadily gaining ground on other inland transport modes in most countries, based on the latest update of ITF’s Annual Trends in the Transport Sector data. A ten-year comparison reveals that 24 of the 27 countries reporting data saw a relative increase in road transport between 2013 and 2023.* 
- <b> CO2 emission standards to achieve Mexico’s 2030 electrification target for light-duty vehicles </b> Tanzila Khan, Carlos Jimenez, Leticia Pineda, Zifei Yang, Josh Miller, and Arijit Sen // ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/co2-emission-standards-to-achieve-mexicos-2030-electrification-target-for-ldvs-jan25/ - *The report suggests that the currently adopted Phase 2 standards will not be sufficient to achieve Mexico’s climate and electrification goals. Furthermore, these standards could potentially drive increase in gCO2/km emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Such increase in ICE emissions can lead to 108 million tonnes additional cumulative emissions during 2024-2050, compared to business-as-usual level.*
- <b> Vision 2050: Update on the global zero-emission vehicle transition in 2024 </b>  Arijit Sen, Jacob Teter, and Josh Miller / ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/vision-2050-global-zev-transition-2024-jan25/ - *This study updates the annual ICCT assessment of global ZEV policies and market developments, analyzing their impact on projected vehicle sales, energy consumption, and emissions through 2050. In addition to policies in the Baseline scenarios designed in previous studies (Baseline 2021 and Baseline 2023), it evaluates three updated scenarios: a Baseline 2024 scenario incorporating policies adopted through August 2024, a Momentum scenario that includes additional proposed policies and targets, and an Ambitious scenario aligned with Paris Agreement goals. The analysis reveals how recent policy developments have substantially increased projected ZEV uptake and provides insights into remaining gaps with a Paris-compatible emissions trajectory.*
- <b> The People’s Republic of China First Biennial Transparency Report on Climate Chang </b> Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), PR China: https://unfccc.int/documents/645296
- <b> European clean tech tracker </b> Simone Tagliapietra, Ben McWilliams, Cecilia Trasi, Ugnė Keliauskaitė, Marie Jugé //Bruegel: https://www.bruegel.org/dataset/european-clean-tech-tracker - *This tracker provides an overview of the main innovation, manufacturing and deployment trends in clean tech in Europe*
- <b> A quantitative urban model for transport appraisal </b> Daniel Hörcher, Daniel J. Graham, ICL: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5067099 -*This paper builds upon the methodological principles of quantitative spatial economics, an emerging eld within the spatial economics literature, to design an appraisal method that captures the interactions between transport supply and the labour, production and real estate markets.*
