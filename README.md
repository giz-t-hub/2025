- <b> Vision 2050: Update on the global zero-emission vehicle transition in 2024 </b> January 2025, Arijit Sen, Jacob Teter, and Josh Miller / ICCT: https://theicct.org/publication/vision-2050-global-zev-transition-2024-jan25/ - *This study updates the annual ICCT assessment of global ZEV policies and market developments, analyzing their impact on projected vehicle sales, energy consumption, and emissions through 2050. In addition to policies in the Baseline scenarios designed in previous studies (Baseline 2021 and Baseline 2023), it evaluates three updated scenarios: a Baseline 2024 scenario incorporating policies adopted through August 2024, a Momentum scenario that includes additional proposed policies and targets, and an Ambitious scenario aligned with Paris Agreement goals. The analysis reveals how recent policy developments have substantially increased projected ZEV uptake and provides insights into remaining gaps with a Paris-compatible emissions trajectory.*
